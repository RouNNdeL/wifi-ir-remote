# Introduction
This is a revised version of the [ESP8266 IR Remote](https://github.com/RouNNdeL/esp8266-remote). It features an ATTiny85 running an [Arduino IR Library](https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote) to send IR codes to my home theater system. The AVR receives commands from the ESP8266 via I<sup>2</sup>C. The ESP connects to WiFi to commuicate with the [Smart Home](https://github.com/RouNNdeL/smart-home) server.
